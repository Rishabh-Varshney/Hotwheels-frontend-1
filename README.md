<h1>The Frontend of Hotwheels</h1>
<p>Hotwheels is an e-commerce platform built with React js,Node js and GraphQL written with react and typescript </p>

5.	TECHNOLOGIES/TOOLS USED
5.1.	TYPESCRIPT
TypeScript is an open-source language that adds static type descriptions to JavaScript, one of the most widely used programming languages.
Types offer a means to define the shape of an object, helping TypeScript to verify that your code is running correctly and having better documentation.
Kind inference helps you to get a lot of control without writing any extra code, so writing types is optional in TypeScript.
Another important thing is that it is well integrated with React and Nest.js.

5.2. REACT
React allows creating immersive UIs a breeze. Create basic views for each state of the app, and react will update and make the appropriate components as the new data. Another feature in react is, building encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
5.3. GRAPHQL
GraphQL is both an API query language and a runtime for executing such queries with your current details. GraphQL allows clients the ability to query for just what they need and nothing more, makes it easy to evolve APIs over time, and facilitates powerful developer resources by providing a full and intuitive summary of the details in your API.

5.4. APOLLO
Apollo Client is a JavaScript state management library that allows you to use GraphQL to handle both local and remote data. It can be used to fetch, store, and change application data while also modifying the user interface.

5.5. NEST.JS
NestJS is a platform for creating flexible and powerful Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is designed with and completely supports TypeScript (while also allowing developers to write in pure JavaScript), and incorporates elements of OOP, FP, and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
Nest uses stable HTTP Server technologies like Express (by default) which can also be programmed to use Fastify.
Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

5.6. POSTGRESQL
PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) based on POSTGRES, Version 4.2, developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department. POSTGRES pioneered many concepts that only became available in some commercial database systems much later.
PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features:
• complex queries
• foreign keys
• triggers
• updatable views
• transactional integrity
• multiversion concurrency control
Also, PostgreSQL can be extended by the user in many ways, for example by adding new
• data types
• functions
• operators
• aggregate functions
• index methods
• procedural languages

5.7. HTML/CSS
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

5.8. TYPEORM
TypeORM is a TypeScript-based Object Relational Mapper library that runs on node.js. TypeScript is a better version of JavaScript that allows for optional typing. A compiled language is TypeScript. At run-time, it is not read. TypeScript files (.ts) are compiled into JavaScript files by the TypeScript compiler (.js).
MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MS SQL Server, Oracle, SAP Hana, and WebSQL are among the databases supported by TypeORM. TypeORM is a simple object-relational mapping (ORM) for building new apps that bind to databases. The TypeORM functionality is based on RDBMS principles.
